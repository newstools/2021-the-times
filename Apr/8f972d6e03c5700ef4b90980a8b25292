Rapper Nasty C has warned fans of a scam using his name and image which asks fans to “borrow” him R3,000. The star took to Instagram this week to post a screenshot of a DM one fan got from a "Nasty C" account, claiming he had reached his bank limit and needed to borrow R3k. "I'll pay you tomorrow morning," the scammer promises. WHY WOULD NASTY C MESSAGE FROM AN UNVERIFIED ACCOUNT? "I'm using my private account," the scammer claims HOW DO YOU KNOW IT IS HIM? The scammer posted a picture of Nasty C smiling, saying "here's proof it is me". Nasty C is not the only celeb to fall prey to scammers. In 2017, a conman hacked Idols SA judge Somizi's phone and sent messages to his contacts asking them for money to bail him out of a desperate situation. One contact gave their rent money to the scammer, expecting to be repaid. Speaking toTshisaLIVE at the time, Somizi's manager Thato Matuka said: "I got the message and was immediately suspicious. I tried to call him but they (the hackers) must have put the phone down on me. IT'S NOT LEGIT! Nasty C told his followers that if anyone who knows him falls for the scam, they are a dummy. "If anyone of my actual friends fall for this I’m really just gonna laugh at you," he captioned the post.
