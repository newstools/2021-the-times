You are a boss who wants nothing but the best for yourself and the people around you! MaMkhize, thank you for your love,” Minnie said before adding her flex. “Did I ever tell you the story about the first time I flew on a private jet? Shauwn’s jet. In Brazil! The biggest private plane on the runway! During the Fifa World Cup! #LEVELS.” Shauwn had a blast on her birthday and posted  videos and snaps to celebrate her trip around the sun. In one of the videos, Shauwn expressed her gratitude to her closest people. “Today it’s about me but I still love you all,” she captioned the video. In the video, Shauwn said she was grateful to God for life and learning the importance of self-love. “This time around, I’ll be celebrating me. All my life I’ve celebrated people, I’ve loved people but they’ve loved themselves and nobody loved me.
