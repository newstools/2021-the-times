Nelson Mandela Bay city bosses have downplayed United Front councillor Mkhuseli Mtsilaâ€™s laying criminal complaints  against them, reducing it to a publicity stunt. Mtsila opened a fraud case against acting city manager Mandla George and economic development executive director Anele Qaba at the Humewood police station in Gqeberha on Thursday. This relates to the awarding of a six-month emergency contract on April 1 to Ezamantlane Trading Enterprise and Bahlaphing Consulting. For more on this article, please visit HeraldLIVE.
