Members of the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal have arrested seven men believed to have been those involved in a cash-in-transit heist in which an armoured vehicle was blown up in broad daylight in northern KZN in March. The incident occurred in Babanango, between Nkandla and Melmoth, and was caught on camera by bystanders at a nearby business premises. In a statement on Wednesday, provincial Hawks spokesperson Capt Simphiwe Mhlongo said five of the alleged perpetrators were arrested last week Monday, while the remaining two were nabbed on Tuesday. “On March 29 security guards were travelling from Nkandla to Melmoth when they were accosted by the suspects at a gunpoint. The suspects fired shots towards the cash van and the driver was forced to stop. They robbed them of their service firearms and undisclosed amount of cash. The suspects then fled  in their getaway motor vehicle.” TimesLIVE reported that the incident occurred along the Umhlathuze bridge.
