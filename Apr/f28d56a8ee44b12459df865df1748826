Angry Kaizer Chiefs fans have singled out goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune after the team sufferedÂ  another defeat, against Cape Town City at FNB stadium on Wednesday night. City's Tashreeq Morris and Amethyst Bradley Ralani scored 22 and 52 minutes into the match, putting Amakhosi under pressure to score two goals to at least draw. The pressure came from on and off the field as fans lashed out at the team on social media. Sixty-seven minutes in, Kearyn Baccus gave Chiefs fans a glimmer of hope when he scored but his efforts were not enough, as they failed to score an equaliser, crushing coach Gavin Hunt's hopes of collecting maximum points against their Cape Town opponents. Amakhosi sunk to  11th spot on the PSL log with 25  points, while Cape Town City, with 33  points, are seventh. Fans largely blamed Khune, saying he has lost his touch and should consider stepping down. Here are some reactions:
