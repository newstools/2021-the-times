On Sunday a blossoming love story came to a tragic end when rapper AKA's 22-year-old fiancée Anele “Nelli” Tembe tragically died. Nelli died on Sunday morning  after she apparently fell from the 10th floor of the five-star Pepperclub Hotel in Cape Town. The Tembe and Forbes families confirmed her death through a statement, saying they were in shock. Mzansi was introduced to Nelli as AKA's girlfriend in early 2020 when a video of her and AKA locking lips at a restaurant went viral. From the moment that paparazzi-style video exposed his relationship with the late Nelli, AKA loved the young woman boldly and made sure the whole world knew he was a man in love. From cute “get to know us as a couple” TikTok videos to shared moments of PDA on his Instagram Stories, or shining a light on Nelli's best qualities, whenever AKA had a chance he didn't hold back on gushing about finding the love of his life. Here are a few of the cutest moments the couple shared with their fans.
