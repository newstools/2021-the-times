An incorrectly programmed human resources system has led to several SABC fixed-term contract  employees  receiving no salaries following extensive deductions. The error has seen a number of SABC employees across all regions  receiving more leave than what was due to them for four years. The error was only picked up this year, which led the public broadcaster to deducting from employees' salaries this month. In a letter  Sowetan has seen which was sent to employees on April 9, the SABC indicated   the leave IT system had erroneously not calculated Saturdays and Sundays which had fallen within an employeeâ€™s period of leave as taken as part of an employee's leave and that this has been the case since 2017.
