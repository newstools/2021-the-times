A criminal charge against prominent journalist Jacques Pauw  has been withdrawn. The veteran investigative journalist and author of the book The President’s Keepers became the news  when he  claimed in his Daily Maverick  article that he had been mistreated by police, arrested and detained following  an incident at a restaurant at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town. In the  article he claimed  he had lost R1,000. He later withdrew the claim. According to Eric Ntabazalila,  spokesperson for the  National Prosecuting Authority in the Western Cape, the journalist had faced a charge of fraud, alternatively theft. Pauw was due to appear in the Cape Town  magistrate’s court on Tuesday, but Ntabazalila revealed the charge had been withdrawn. “I have just been informed by the prosecutor that the charge against Jacques Pauw  has been withdrawn at the request of the complainant [the restaurant],” said Ntabazalila. Pauw was not immediately available for comment. TimesLIVE
