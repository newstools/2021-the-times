Police have confirmed the arrest of a suspect in connection with a homophobic attack in the Free State. Segakweng Kimora Magoma was left battered and bruised last weekend after allegedly being attacked by a group of homophobic men at a bar in Sasolburg. The traumatised 32-year-old man told TimesLIVE earlier this week he was with a friend when an unknown man approached and called him a derogatory term in Sesotho for a gay man. In response, he told the man to call his mother. The man started attacking him. “Within a few minutes, about five or six men already were there, stabbing me with bottles. Fortunately, a bouncer saw what was happening and immediately came to my rescue,” said Magoma. He sustained cuts and scratches to his face and ear. He also had a deep cut on his hand. Free State police spokesperson Brig Motantsi Makhele confirmed that a 33-year-old suspect was arrested on Friday. “He will appear at the Sasolburg magistrate’s court on Monday on a charge of assault [with intent to cause grievous bodily harm] GBH,” he said.
