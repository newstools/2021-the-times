A number of states in Brazil are in critical condition and hospitals are overwhelmed by the Covid-19 pandemic, World Health Organisation epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told a briefing on Thursday. "Indeed there is a very serious situation going on in Brazil right now, where we have a number of states in critical condition," she said, adding that many hospital intensive care units are more than 90% full. Brazil, where a more transmissible virus variant is circulating, has become an epicenter of the pandemic. Reuters
