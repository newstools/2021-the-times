Police were on Sunday morning investigating the death of 22-year-old Nelli Tembe, the fianc√©e of well-known musician AKA, at the five-star Pepperclub Hotel in central Cape Town. AKA's manager, Phumza Nohashe, confirmed the death and said the Forbes and Tembe families would release a statement soon. Witnesses at the scene described hearing shouting and a "loud doof" sound, and said they had heard a man calling security and crying. Western Cape SA Police Service media liaison Capt FC van Wyk said crime-scene experts were looking for clues at the hotel. "Cape Town Central police are investigating an inquest case after an incident at a hotel this morning at about 7.45am on the corners of Loop and Bloem streets, Cape Town CBD, where the body of a 22-year-old woman was found deceased," the police said in a statement. A source close to the musician said he was "inconsolable". Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said paramedics were also at the scene. Earlier, a hotel manager who would only give her name as Dumi denied that there had been any incident at the hotel, though police confirmed the road outside the hotel had been blocked off. This is a developing story.
