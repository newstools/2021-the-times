A Chadian rebel group advancing south from Libya said it rejected a military transition led by the son of President Idriss Deby, who died on Monday, and vowed to march on the capital N'Djamena. Mahamat Idriss Deby was named interim president by a transitional council of military officers on Tuesday after his father was killed in battle, an army spokesman said. "Chad is not a monarchy. There can be no dynastic devolution of power in our country," the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) rebels said in a statement. Reuters
