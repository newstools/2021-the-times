The KwaZulu-Natal government has condemned the brutal murders of two police officers in Pietermaritzburg, saying the latest attack shows officers remain the targets of criminals. Acting transport and community safety MEC Kwazi Mshengu has appealed to investigators to leave no stone unturned in the search  for the men behind the execution-style murders of police sergeants Makhosaze Mdlangathi, 33, and Mfikelwa Mtolo, 36. The off-duty officers, who were in a relationship, were apparently driving  to Mtolo’s homestead on Saturday night when unknown suspects ambushed them at Taylor’s Halt near Pietermaritzburg. About 30 pistol and rifle cartridges were found on the scene, and the couple had multiple gunshot wounds in their bodies. Their firearms were not found at the scene. “It is disturbing that our police officers continue to be killed in such a brutal and senseless manner. We condemn the heinous double-murder of Sgt Mdlangathi and Sgt Mtolo, who were both very young and had a lot to offer the police service. “These murders come days after another police officer was shot and killed while protecting a gender-based violence victim, which clearly demonstrates police continue to be targeted. “As prescribed in the constitution, police are there to protect, prevent, combat and investigate crime, therefore an attack on police is a direct attack on the state. This has serious consequences on law enforcement deployment because the state invests a lot of money in police training and education. “The threat to the lives of police members will not be tolerated and we urge police to defend themselves by all means necessary should they be under  attack,” said Mshengu. The motive for the latest killings is unknown at this stage and no arrests have been made. TimesLIVE
