China denies that US diplomats were required to take anal swab tests for COVID-19 China's foreign ministry on Thursday denied that U.S. diplomats in the country were asked to take anal swabs for COVID-19, following media reports that some U.S. diplomats had complained about the procedure. U.S. media outlet Vice on Wednesday cited a U.S. State Department official as saying that the test was given in error and that China had said it would stop using the swabs for testing of U.S. diplomats. "To my knowledge ... China has never required U.S. diplomatic staff stationed in China to conduct anal swab tests," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily news briefing on Thursday. -REUTERS Czech government bans travel to South Africa, Brazil due to virus variants The Czech Republic will ban travel by its citizens to several African and South American countries where there is high risk from new South African or Brazilian coronavirus variants, the government said on Wednesday. The government is seeking to slow a fast-rising COVID-19 infection rate that has put stress on the central European country's hospitals. Lawmakers have debated tighter measures to combat the spread. The health ministry said the travel ban would be in effect from Feb. 26 to April 11, with some exceptions. It includes countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and others. The ministry has reported some new COVID-19 infections suspected to be from the South African variant but has not confirmed those cases. -REUTERS
