The SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) has submitted a bid to host the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) congress in Durban in December‚ president Barry Hendricks said on Tuesday. The deadline for submissions was midnight Monday‚ and it’s understood a few other cities are in the running too‚ including Kigali‚ Rwanda. “We are working with the city of eThekwini and the province of KwaZulu-Natal‚” he said. Sascoc was in the process of adding the word Paralympic to its name‚ examining ways of incorporating it without making the acronym too cumbersome‚ added Hendricks.
