A Sudanese asylum seeker who fatally stabbed an employee at a migrant reception centre in the southern French city of Pau on Friday had no terrorist motives, the Pau prosecutor said on Saturday. She said that following Friday's attack the assailant had been detained by two staff of the asylum centre.
