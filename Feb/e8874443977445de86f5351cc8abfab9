The much anticipated  2021  budget speech took place on Wednesday, with many South Africans  anxious to hear what  finance minister Tito Mboweni would say as the world continues to battle a pandemic. Surprisingly, no major tax increases were announced - but  fuel, carbon tax, sin tax and national debt saw an increase. Mboweni did say that government debt was  unfortunately extremely high. A lot of  money will be allocated to the purchase and rollout of much-needed vaccines, alongside a new initiative that will be allocated for   emergencies that may arise during the vaccine rollout. Mboweni said  SA is in a much better financial position  compared with October 2020, just a few months ago. TimesLIVE
