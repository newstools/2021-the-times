The pass rates for the other provinces (excluding progressed pupils) were: Of the 85 districts in the country, only two achieved a pass rate of 50-59%, while 83 districts achieved a pass rate of 60% and above. Mweli said that one province accounted for six of the top 10 districts while another accounted for three and a third province accounted for one of the top 10 districts.
