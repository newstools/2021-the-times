Eskom customers are in for a hefty rise in the price of electricity as the power utility is set to increase its tariff by 15.63% from the beginning of April. The increase comes after the National Energy Regulator of SA (Nersa) agreed to Eskom’s request for a tariff increase for the 2021/2022 financial year. BusinessLIVE reported that Eskom won a case in the high court last year, which allowed it to push for a higher tariff increase than Nersa was willing to allow. The court ordered Nersa to add R10bn to Eskom’s allowable revenue to be recovered from tariff customers in the 2021/2022 financial year. Eskom was permitted to recover R23bn in the 2021/2022 financial year as per a court judgment handed down in July 2020. The court order stated that “an amount of 5.44c/kWh will be added to the average standard tariff for Eskom customers in the 2021/22 tariff year making the aggregate standard tariff for Eskom customers in the 2021/22 tariff year 134.30c/kWh”. Load-shedding until 2022 Last year September, parliament's standing committee on appropriations said it expects power cuts to persist for at least the next year, warning that load-shedding up to stage 3 was likely to remain until 2022 depending on pressure on the system. The committee said load-shedding will be required from February to March 2021 for the unplanned capability loss factor (UCLF) at 11,000MW. Based on the same power loses, it is believed that load-shedding will also be required between June and July 2021.
