Portrait enthusiast Lebani Sirenje, aka “Rasta”, has got tongues wagging yet again after his painting of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made its way onto the internet. Known for botching  portraits of famous people, dead or alive, Rasta proved  again that his painting skills  might need a bit of honing. In his bid to congratulate Prince Harry and Meghan on the news that they're expecting a second child, Rasta took to Twitter and shared snaps of the portraits he painted in honour of the royals. While Rasta thought he nailed the portrait of the royal couple, social media users came at him for yet another botched job. Here are some of the reactions: Earlier this month, Rasta's painting of late opera singer and jazz icon Sibongile Khumalo failed to impress the TL. In her honour, Rasta took the opportunity to admire the musician with his art by dedicating two paintings to her. He took to Twitter and shared the two portraits with a caption that read, “Laying Sibongile to rest at Market Theatre”. But the artworks  were not welcomed  by social media users, who urged him to put down his brushes. Speaking to TshisaLIVE last year about the backlash his paintings often get, Rasta said people were too quick to judge his works of art. “People can't just wake up and say I must stop painting, that would kill me ... Rather they must say, go change this or learn this and I'll improve.”
