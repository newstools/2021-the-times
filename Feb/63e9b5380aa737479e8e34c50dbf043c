Actress Rami Chuene took to Twitter with some advice for public figures on participating in viral internet challenges. If there is one thing about the lockdown, it's the Tik Tok challenges that everyone and their mom has been enjoying. The most recent  to makes waves is the Silhouette challenge. Users are seen establishing their surroundings and then fade to a dim red lighting to show off their nude silhouette. However, Rami  said that these challenges are definitely not for those representing big brands in the entertainment industry. The star advised  followers to be  careful when participating in challenges. The Isono actress says that if you are representing a client or brand, they may find some of these challenges “off-brand”, even if they are just for  fun. “Some trends and challenges are not really for you to participate in. Which is unfair cos we all wanna have fun. Bummer is, some clients are extra fussy when it comes to their brands. Rather miss out on the ‘fun’  than wiggle yourself out of work,” wrote Rami. The star is often looking out for those in the entertainment industry in her online interaction. Last year, Rami penned an open letter to sport, arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa. She highlighted her experience working for well known filmmakers, the Fergusons. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, Rami said speaking out against the alleged mistreatment of artists had always been her prerogative. However, social media has amplified conversations. “I have always been vocal about people who don’t treat artists properly. I have always been outspoken about that. I think right now what has made this particular saga is because of how Black Twitter works, all of a sudden everyone has something to say. “Everyone who knows me, knows that it is important for artists, or employers and employees, to have mutual respect for what we are doing and coexist,” Rami said.
