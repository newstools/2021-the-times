Residents in the Vaal were besides themselves after it was reported the Vaal Dam had filled  to 100% capacity. The recent heavy rain falls in Gauteng have given the dam a much-needed boost. In 2020 the dam was at just 57%. The last time the dam was at 100% capacity was in early 2017 and, according to aÂ tweet from Johannesburg Water, the last time it was this full before then was six years ago. TimesLIVE
