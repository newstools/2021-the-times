Wearing a black diamond piece makes a bold statement about who you are: individual, unique, and perhaps even a bit daring. Black diamonds contrast beautifully with a silver, platinum or gold setting, or when worn in combination with a clear diamond. It’s only in recent decades that these entrancing gemstones have gained popularity and taken their rightful place as high-end stones that should be enjoyed just like their more well-known counterparts such as clear diamonds, rubies, sapphires and the like. Whichever black diamond piece, jewellery creation or luxury watch you choose, make sure you pick out the perfect gift idea this Valentine’s month from Murdocks Jewellers in the V&A Waterfront. WIN: An 18K white gold 0.97ct total white diamond and black rhodium Love Times Infinity ring from Murdocks Jewellery valued at R88,290.
