Tiger Woods underwent additional procedures on Friday in Los Angeles to treat injuries sustained in a Tuesday car crash. Woods’ Twitter account posted Friday evening, “Tiger has moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and received follow-up procedures on his injuries this morning. The procedures were successful, and he is now recovering and in good spirits. “Tiger and his family want to thank you all for the wonderful support and messages they have received over the past few days. We will not have any further updates at this time. Thank you for your continued privacy.” Woods, 45, was hurt in an early-morning, single-car crash near the border of Rolling Hills Estates, California, and Rancho Palos Verdes, California. Emergency personnel extracted him from his car and transported him to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. He underwent surgery Tuesday to treat multiple injuries to his right lower leg, including the insertion of a rod into the tibia. Additional screws and pins were needed in the leg, and he was treated for muscle and soft-tissue injuries. Woods subsequently was moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center “for continuing orthopaedic care and recovery”, according to a Thursday statement from Dr Anish Mahajan, the chief medical officer and interim CEO at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.
