It wasn't the Valentine's Day gift that Jwaneng Galaxy were hoping for after they were punished by visitors Orlando Pirates in a Caf Confederation Cup first round play-off match in Botswana on Sunday afternoon. Pirates handed their hosts a 3-0 beating in a match that moved the SA side a step closer to the group stages of the continental tournament. A first-half header from defender Thulani Hlatshwayo got the ball rolling after he powered home the opener after a corner kick from Deon Hotto in the 32nd minute. Two goals in the second half from Linda Mntambo and Jean-Marc Mundele secured a comfortable win for the Bucs.
