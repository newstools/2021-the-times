Photographer and plus-size model Thickleeyonce has had enough of body shamers on the socials and has decided to put them in their place. The body-positive activist took a stand against trolls who consistently judge  overweight women for what  they eat in  tweets on Twitter in which she bashed them for being “so evil”. Her “fat shaming” tweets were sparked by a tweep who told her it was too early for her to be craving pizza. The tweep even suggested the plus-size model hit the gym instead of eating junk food. Feeling the tweep was out of line, Leeyonce simply told herself not to worry whether or not she was healthy. She then told  her off, saying her unsolicited advice was not needed. Leeyonce she she was baffled by people who always turn into “doctors” and have  something to say when it comes to what a fat person eats, but have nothing to say when skinny people eat unhealthy food. Leeyonce  said fat shamers didn’t necessarily care about the health of big people but rather wanted to police them about what they can and cannot eat. Feeling hurt by the amount of hate and negative comments thrown at fat people, Thickleeyonce said she can never get used to how evil people can be on Twitter.
