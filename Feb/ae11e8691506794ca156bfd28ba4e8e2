President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Thursday deliver his much anticipated state of the nation address (Sona). With Covid-19 having wreaked economic havoc in the country, many South Africans are waiting  to hear what plans the president and his administration have in place to help those hardest hit by the pandemic.
