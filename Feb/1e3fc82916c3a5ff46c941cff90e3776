They said it would all end in tears ... Check some of the reactions below: However, Lasizwe stans were  ready to defend their idol. Here are some of the reactions from fans who just want to see the social media sensation happy: Though the star may be cuffed now, last year he had other plans for his love life. Taking to Twitter, the comedy king opened up to fans about his rules of engagement. He said he was down for a casual relationship and nothing too serious. “I have come to the conclusion that I want a situationship and not a relationship going forward. “Basically, I am here for a good time not a long time because I excel with flying colours in a situationship and the best part is the trading hours set up that comes with a situationship,” wrote Lasizwe. Regardless, congratulations to you on your new relationship Lasizwe! #LoveWins
