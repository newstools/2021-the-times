Former president Jacob Zuma will on Wednesday visit  #FeesMustFall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile at his home in Umlazi, south of Durban. Khanyile, who is currently under house arrest,  told TimesLIVE he could not divulge the context of Zuma’s visit until they had concluded their talks. “I can only divulge once I have met  him. We have been in communication with him, but he deemed it fit to come to  visit  me. I knew for some time  he would be coming but I was only informed on Tuesday that he has confirmed.” The former  Durban University of Technology student was arrested during the #FeesMustFall protests and charged on eight counts, including public violence and inciting violence, on September 2 2016. In January 2019 he was sentenced to three years’ house arrest and ordered to submit himself for rehabilitation programmes and pay R5,000 or serve a three-year prison sentence suspended for five years. Khanyile has openly shown his affiliation to Zuma. In a tweet on Monday, Khanyile drew comparison between Zuma’s recent defiance to appear before the state capture inquiry and that of Robert Sobukwe’s fight against the apartheid regime. TimesLIVE
