A family in Mooi River,  KwaZulu-Natal, is preparing to bury a 24-year-old DJ who died after being shot following an alleged argument over a mask. Zama Mchunu told TimesLIVE that she was alerted to the shooting of her brother Lindokuhle, a local DJ, at the Mooi Mpofana municipal offices on Tuesday by a friend. “I was shocked and confused when I received a text from a friend who said that Lindo was shot at the municipal office. Another brother and I were in town and when we got  there we found that there was blood all over Lindo's pants,” she said. She said he and a friend had gone to the office to request official documents. The family was informed that Lindo and his friend were involved in an alleged argument after he apparently wasn't wearing a mask, and that a security guard intervened. “We rushed him to a clinic but he didn't make it. His last words to me were 'asambeni' ['let's go' in Zulu] and that broke me.” Mchunu said the family was also informed that a female municipal employee was involved in the alleged argument. KZN Saps spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele said: “A case of murder was opened at Mooi River police station and a 31-year-old man was arrested. He is expected to appear today [Thursday] in the Mooi River magistrate's court.” She said Mooi River police received a complaint of a murder at Claughton Terrace in Mooi River on Tuesday. “On arrival they were informed that a 24-year-old male was shot by a security guard in the thigh after an argument. The victim was taken to hospital where he succumbed to his injury.” Mchunu will be buried on Friday. TimesLIVE
