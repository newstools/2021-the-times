President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his fifth State of the Nation Address in parliament on Thursday night, addressing matters on vaccine rollouts, corruption, renewable  energy procurement,  Covid-19 relief grant extensions and more. The much-anticipated address was attended by a limited number of MPs  while others joined virtually. The president talked tough on corruption, stating that the implementation of the national anti-corruption strategy will soon be under way with the appointment of the members of  the anti-corruption advisory council. Ramaphosa also announced the extension of some Covid-19 grant relief measures, namely the Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (Ters) and the R350 unemployment social grant for a further three months.
