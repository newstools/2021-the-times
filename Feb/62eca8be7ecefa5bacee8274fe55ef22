The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of access to quality health care, and we would like to make the start of 2021 a little easier for you. The contributions to all Discovery Heath Medical Scheme plans did not increase on January 1 2021, and will remain at the 2020 rate for the first six months of 2021. This means that your health plan contributions will increase only from July 1 2021. The contribution increase to be announced in May 2021 will not be higher than 5.9%. A delayed contribution increase further supports all our members through the first half of 2021, after a challenging 2020. In 2021, Discovery Health Medical Scheme will also enhance benefits for a more personalised, connected health-care experience at any stage of your health-care journey. This video provides an overview of these enhancements. Read more about your Discovery Health Medical Scheme benefits for 2021. This article was paid for by Discovery Health.
