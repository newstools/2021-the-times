Cogta minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has officially extended the Disaster Management Act for another month. In a statement last week, Cabinet said it has agreed to extend the legislation - under which all Covid-19 regulations fall - for another month. Dlamini-Zuma on Thursday published a gazette officially enacting this decision. SA health ombud and molecular immunologist Professor Malegapuru Makgoba is fiercely opposed to the rollout of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine in SA, saying that from a scientific and public health point of view it would be irrational. “The AstraZeneca vaccine is not efficacious. It was efficacious against the original, wild virus but it is not against the variant dominant in SA,” he said. The new variant, known as B1.351 or 501Y.V2, is the current dominant variant in SA.
