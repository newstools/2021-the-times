Long-serving DA MP and the party's  former deputy chief whip, Mike Waters, has resigned as a MP. This was announced by party chief whip Natasha Mazzone in an internal letter to the party's caucus on Friday. Mazzone said though Waters was resigning as a MP, he would still remain a DA member, working with the party in Gauteng. “It is with a very heavy heart but a great deal of understanding that I inform you all that effective immediately, our dear friend and colleague Michael Waters has resigned as a member of parliament. “At the onset, I wish to inform you that Mike remains a loyal and dedicated member of the DA. He has simply taken the decision to change his life course, work with the DA from within his province, and pursue different passions and adventures,” she said. Mazzone said as one of the longest-serving MPs in the party, Waters had enjoyed a distinguished career. “He  served the party - and most importantly, the people of South Africa - with continued excellence and diligence. “Although my heart pains as I write this letter, I completely understand and respect Mike's decision. I personally owe a great debt of gratitude to Mike for mentoring me, giving freely of his knowledge, being a wonderful colleague, but most of all, being a wonderful friend,” said Mazzone. Waters served as deputy chief whip to John Steenhuisen in the last term before he lost this position to Jacques Julius. He  also served in the party's federal executive as deputy federal chairperson until the last congress. In that position he led the charge against former party leader Mmusi Maimane and his allies. Last year, former DA Gauteng leader John Moodey was forced to resign from the party, facing charges after he allegedly colluded to frame Waters in an alleged sex-for-jobs scandal. At the time, Waters had vowed to take legal action against Moodey. TimesLIVE
