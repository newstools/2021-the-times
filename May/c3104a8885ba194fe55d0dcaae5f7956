Roseline Siegel believes her son Liam Jevono, 14, would not have been shot and killed, allegedly by a security guard during the Mangaung shutdown protests, had he been at school. Liam, a reserved grade 7 pupil at Heide Primary in Heidedal, Bloemfontein, became a victim  of the violent service delivery protests that swept through townships around the Free State capital on Monday morning.
