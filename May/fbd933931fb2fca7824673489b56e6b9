We are living in turbulent times, in a Vuca world, the managerial acronym that means volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. Marketers and brand owners have been experiencing this in abundance over the past year. And in times of unpredictability, the ability of businesses to make firm, sober-minded decisions appears to be a mix of art and science. Business confidence has taken a knock, among giants and start-ups alike, brands have been forced to rewrite strategies and shift direction seemingly overnight, consumers have held back on spending, and everyone has been treading on economic eggshells. Amid the chaos, however, the media and advertising industries have been driven to innovate with alternative paths and fresh approaches for reaching and making an impact on consumers. The year 2020 brought a lot of challenges in the industry with the impact of Covid-19, which saw a drop in advertising spend of no less than 30% globally, with SA being no exception. During this time, VodaMedia worked with Google to help move away from the unpredictable to shape a predictable future for small and big publishers, with a modern media ecosystem model for content consumers and advertisers.
