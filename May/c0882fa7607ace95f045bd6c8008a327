Ferguson Films producer and actor Shona Ferguson believes black people don't hold each other accountable and that ignoring the wrongdoings of others can actually be detrimental to them. In  a 15-minute monologue posted on Instagram, the Rockville actor dished some words of wisdom where he advised people to call each other out when the other does something wrong. “As black people, we never hold each other accountable, it has become so easy for us to blame someone for something. We allow certain things to happen within ourselves and our circles that we shouldn't. The first thing, we never call each other out when we brutally and blatantly go out of our way to pull down and destroy another successful person.” Echoing the words of rapper Cassper Nyovest, Shona also spoke about how he got into the habit of cutting people out of his life for his peace of mind. “I made it a point that if you are going to be in my circle, you are negative and you are toxic, I'm going to cut you out — I don't care who you are. I'm not going to have regrets about it. If you are negative and toxic in my circle you are gone. It's simple,” he said.

The actor, who often posts encouraging notes and Bible scriptures on his Instagram, is a huge fan of prioritising inner peace over keeping toxic people in your life. Shona revealed in November 2020 that he's learnt to protect his peace and block negative energy. In a social media post, Shona lifted the lid on how he's found inner peace by “cutting off” certain people, with his wife Connie Ferguson backing him up saying, “You and I both”. Sharing a black picture with white bold fonts, Shona wrote, “The level of inner peace I have found is extremely dangerous because anything or anyone that disturbs it, is gone. “My cut off game is on a 100!” he remarked at the time.
