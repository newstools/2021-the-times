The Gauteng health department on Monday raised the alarm over “notable increases” in the number of new Covid-19 cases in the province. Department spokesperson Kwara Kekana said new cases had increased across the province, particularly in the Sedibeng district, compared to the week before. “In the past two weeks, an increased number of new cases were also recorded in the Emfuleni, Tshwane 3 and Johannesburg D subdistricts,” Kekana said. The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Gauteng as of May 2 was 424,326, with 410,573 recoveries and 10,664 deaths. The department has urged residents to do their part to contain transmission of the virus by adhering to the preventive measures, including physical distancing, wearing of masks, and hand hygiene, and to seek care as soon as  symptoms develop. “Non-pharmaceutical measures remain the best method of containing the spread of the coronavirus. We all have a part to play to stop the spread,” she said. Kekana said the province would continue to monitor adherence to Covid-19 measures in communities, as well as in schools, workplaces and on public transport. A total  of 1,311 people are now  hospitalised in public and private facilities. Kekana said  as of Friday April 30, 78,941 healthcare workers had been vaccinated in the province since the start of the Sisonke study vaccination programme. TimesLIVE
