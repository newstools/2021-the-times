DJ Prince Kaybee has issued a public apology for “disappointing” and “humiliating” those close to him in the wake of cheating accusations levelled against him on social media.

The conversation, which went viral on Twitter on Tuesday night, alluded to them sharing more than a platonic relationship. “I cheated, I humiliated my girlfriend publicly.
