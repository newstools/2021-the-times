A moving prayer service kicked off the official state memorial of the late Zulu regent, Queen Shiyiwe Mantfombi  Dlamini Zulu, at KwaKhangelamankengane royal palace in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Friday. The queen passed on last week after a short stay at Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg. She was 65 years old. She was laid to rest at the crack of dawn on Thursday in a private burial. Those in attendance  include former president Jacob Zuma, premier Sihle Zikakalala and Amazulu traditional prime minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Massive portraits of the late queen, adorned in white flowers, greeted mourners at the memorial. Outside the palace funeral artist Lebani “Rasta” Sirenje was  present to display his artworks. Rasta told TimesLIVE he had travelled from Johannesburg to be a part of the historic event. “I came to pay my respects to the queen. As I always  honour the legends with paintings, I thought it is befitting to have one of the king.” Rasta said he would  donate one of the portraits to the royal family as a gift. “As artists we are different in how we pay tribute to legends. I felt  this will make people realise that art is instrumental in life. “Every time I make a painting in honour of a fallen hero, I usually give one to the family and keep one for myself  in case of an exhibition in future.” TimesLIVE
