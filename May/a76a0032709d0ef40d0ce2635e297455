Embattled power utility Eskom said on Wednesday that it would be implementing stage 1 load-shedding from 5pm to 10pm. This, Eskom said, was because of a “shortage in generating capacity”. The rotational power cuts come after  warnings on Tuesday afternoon and on Wednesday morning that the electricity generation network was under threat. “This load-shedding is required as a result of a shortage in generating capacity due to breakdowns and delays in returning generator units to service,” Eskom said in a statement. “Eskom teams are working to return more generators to service as soon as possible. Should the generators not return as expected, further load-shedding might be required during the week.” TimesLIVE
