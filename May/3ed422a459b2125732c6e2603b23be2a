SA has ramped up available liquid oxygen to hospitals by roughly eight times ahead of the third wave of infections, says Prof Ian Sanne, a member of the Covid-19 ministerial advisory committee. Oxygen shortages threatened and compromised the treatment of critically ill Covid-19  patients during the second wave. “SA has an oxygen production capacity approximately eight times the rate at which oxygen is used in winter months without Covid-19. This amount will be sufficient to support hospitals that may face a rapid increase in patients in the third wave,” said Sanne. China on Monday reported a sudden surge in Covid-19 infections in the country’s south, with 18 new local cases on May 30 in the city of Guangzhou, causing a flurry of flight cancellations.

On Monday health authorities in Guangdong province said out of the 20 new locally confirmed patients on May 30, 18 were found in Guangzhou city and two in Foshan city.
