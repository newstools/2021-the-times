The state capture commission had to urgently adjourn on Thursday  for “serious security reasons”. Shortly before 7pm, during the testimony of Norma Mngoma, a note was handed to commission chair deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo saying they had to break for a “protector related issue”. He returned about five minutes later to confirm a security issue and to say they would have to return in the morning. Details were not provided. The commission's official Twitter account tweeted: “DCJ [deputy chief justice] has been informed that there are serious security reasons for the commission to adjournment.” In an Instagram post, Mngoma said she was "in safe hands". "I want to thank the SAPS for protecting me. I can’t say much about what happened but I want to assure everyone I’m in safe hands," she said. TimesLIVE
