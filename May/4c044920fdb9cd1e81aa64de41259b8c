Taking my son with me, I think it will be an amazing journey, because soon enough I will be throwing the mic in this construction industry and it will be an honour for me to take my legacy and send it to my son. Considering where I come from. “I never thought that one day I would be walking on-site with my son, teaching him the ropes,” she said.
