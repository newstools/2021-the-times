President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to hold a “family meeting” soon, where he is set to update the country on the measures that government will put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19 amid a looming third wave. Acting minister in the presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni made the announcement on Thursday. She said the cabinet met during the week to discuss further lockdown measures with health officials. A new report has revealed a “dangerous increase” in the illicit alcohol trade in 2020 in SA, as a direct consequence of the alcohol ban during lockdown. According to a report by Euromonitor International on illicit alcohol sales in SA, the ban resulted in an increase in the demand for illicit alcohol — something which further motivated syndicates to take advantage of the depressed legal market to make profits. The report was jointly commissioned by the South African Liquor Brand Owners Association (Salba), the Beer Association of South Africa (Basa) and Vinpro. SA recorded 4,424 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, as a total of 828,204 people have now been vaccinated in the country. Under the Sisonke Programme, with the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine, 479,768 people have been vaccinated. The total number of people vaccinated in phase two as of midnight on Thursday was 348,436, with the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Figures released by health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize showed that the new infections came from 43,442 tests.
