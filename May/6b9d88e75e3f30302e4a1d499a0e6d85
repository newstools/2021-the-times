Watch the clips below Last week, cabin footage from the attempted heist went viral on social media. In the video Prinsloo could be seen looking in the rear-view mirror moments before a series of bullets hit the reinforced glass of his Toyota Land Cruiser. Speaking on the incident, Prinsloo said he is always prepared for the worst. “You sort of need to expect things like that to happen because it prepares your mind for what you need to do. When we train people we tell them to pre-visualise what they are going to do. It’s a mindset.” According to Advanced Tactical Training, Prinsloo has served in protection teams guarding famous people including former president Nelson Mandela, Kim Kardashian and Prince Charles.
