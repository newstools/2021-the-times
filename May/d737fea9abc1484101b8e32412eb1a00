My heart overflows with gratitude.”  Boity wrote on social media. Check out the snaps: Fans and friends  only had the kindest words for the media personality. “Mr Buns” Maps penned a heartfelt letter to his best friend on her birthday. “It’s my bestie's birthday and her name Boitumelo couldn’t be more apt for all the joy she brings into people’s lives. The world’s been blessed to have you on it for 31 years, and I can’t wait to see what happens in the next 31 and beyond,” he wrote. Happy Birthday to our queen Boity! 31 never looked better.
