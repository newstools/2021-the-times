Former Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa has questioned those who thought ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule would vacate his position last week owing to the step-aside rule. Magashule had 30 days to consult senior party members before announcing whether he would  step aside. The period lapsed last Friday  but Magashule held on to his position. He is facing corruption charges relating to a  multimillion-rand Free State asbestos eradication tender that was awarded during his tenure as  premier of the province. Sunday Times Daily reported he will not step aside without a fight and  this will force the ruling party to suspend him. It is then expected he will seek to appeal the decision. On Monday, Shilowa said it is baffling that some people expected Magashule to step aside. “ANC is for ANC and ANC only. You are collateral,” he tweeted. Magashule’s last meeting was with former presidents Kgalema Motlanthe and Thabo Mbeki. On Sunday he told the ANC’s top six he will not be stepping aside. BusinessLIVE reported on Tuesday that President Cyril Ramaphosa won the “unequivocal” backing of the other five ANC top six officials for  Magashule to step aside pending the outcome of his fraud and corruption case. These include deputy president David Mabuza, national chair Gwede Mantashe and deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte.
