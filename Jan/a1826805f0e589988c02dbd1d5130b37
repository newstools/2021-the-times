Musician and rapper AKA took to Twitter to send love and light to workers facing difficulties under the coronavirus lockdown. The Fela In Versace hitmaker, who has recently gone into the hospitality business with the Durban-based club and restaurant Cuba BLK, has wished workers well through trying days of Covid-19. In a heartfelt dedication, the rapper said he is praying that everything will be OK for those who work in the hospitality and entertainment industries. As some South Africans returned to work on Monday after the festive season break, the implementation of Covid-19 safety measures was high on the list of priorities for workers and employers. The department of employment and labour called on businesses to ensure safe working environments for employees by designating Covid-19 compliance officers. The opportunity created by the initial lockdown period was not adequately used to prepare the health-care system for the second wave of infections, the  Freedom Front Plus said on Monday. Speaking after President Cyril Ramaphosa indicated that SA will remain on lockdown level three in the midst of a sharp rise in new Covid-19 cases, the party said this proved that the government had overreacted last year when it implemented draconian measures that had caused needless damage to the economy. “The opportunity created by the initial lockdown period was not adequately used to prepare the health-care system for the second wave of infections. “The field hospitals that were erected were taken down again while knowing full well that a second wave was on its way,” the party said.
