White Gold actress Refilwe Modiselle says she can relate to the backlash and hate that the LGBTQI+ community are currently facing on Twitter. With the discussions about transphobic, homophobia and LGBTQI+ people heating up the TL, many, including our faves, have weighed-in and slammed the discrimination that has had tongues wagging on Twitter. Model Refilwe took to Twitter to stand in solidarity with the gay community. The star said society should have already progressed past  hating LGBTQI+ people. “In 2021, when society is meant to be a lot more progressive, we have to deal with homophobes ... It's not fair & it's not right,” she tweeted. The star went on to say that she can relate to the battles  the LGBTQI+ community is facing online. She said that as a person with albinism, she  has had to battle against the discrimination thrown her way. “(It's) A fight I can relate to somehow, as a person living with albinism. I understand the pain to always have to 'educate' society repeatedly. It's tiring,” Refilwe wrote. Refilwe often takes to the TL as an activist,  clapping back at discrimination and hate online. In an interview with TshisaLIVE, Refilwe emphasised the importance of representing marginalised communities in media such as in the film White Gold, which won the star multiple awards for her acting. “Representation matters and people need to stop marginalising us, as people living with albinism. To say that we are not in the shadows, we are people ... to not be discriminated against. This industry in particular has to do better in terms of not shutting people out because of what they think people will gravitate towards and judge people based on their capabilities.”
