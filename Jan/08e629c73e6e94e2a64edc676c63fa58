She had fallen asleep with the lights on, and identified  the intruder as a neighbour. “The suspect allegedly threatened the victim with a knife and raped her. After that he robbed the victim of her TV set, which was in the bedroom. He used the same broken window pane to exit the house with TV set and blanket.” The victim contacted police just after six on Friday morning. Police said the suspect is expected to appear before Kestell magistrate's court soon. TimesLIVE
