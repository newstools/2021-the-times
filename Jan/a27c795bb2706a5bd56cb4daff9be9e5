The state capture inquiry continues to hear evidence related to the State Security Agency (SSA) from “Ms K”. On Thursday, the inquiry heard evidence relating to former state security minister David Mahlobo, who has been ducking and diving from accounting for his role in the illegalities that took place in the SSA under his watch. Instead, when an investigation team set up by the new regime at SSA tried to get answers from him in 2018, Mahlobo threatened to spill the beans on then-minister of state security Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba. This was revealed at the  inquiry on Thursday during the testimony of an unidentified operative referred to as “Ms K”. Mahlobo stands accused of having collected cash payments for two suspicious SSA operations. One mission was named Project Commitment, under which Mahlobo allegedly collected  R78m in  cash. The money, the inquiry heard, was said to be intended for then president Jacob Zuma, though no-one had proof Zuma received the money. The hearing continues. TimesLIVE
