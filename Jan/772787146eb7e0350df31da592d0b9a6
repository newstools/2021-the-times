A hijacked property was handed over to its  owner  in Doornfontein, in eastern Johannesburg, on Thursday  and 40 suspects  at the property were arrested during a sting operation by JMPD and the city’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service (GFIS). The suspects were expected to appear in the Jeppestown magistrate’s court on Thursday, but TimesLIVE was informed they would in fact appear on Friday. They will face charges of trespassing, malicious damage to property and contempt of court. According to a statement by the city of Johannesburg, it is alleged that the property was recently hijacked by a number of people who forcefully took occupation and control of the building. “The owners approached the high court where an eviction order was granted in December last year. The eviction was executed and security personnel were hired to guard the property. However, the suspects attacked them  and forcefully moved back into the property the next day,” reads the statement. The matter was then reported to the police and to the city’s GFIS for investigation. The city said it was committed to  stopping the rot in the city and to make it a prosperous and inclusive place “for our people to live, work and play in”. “The city asks  people to report fraud and corruption through the 24-hour tipoff hotline 0800 002 587, or to visit the offices of GFIS  at 48 Ameshoff Street, Braamfontein,” reads the statement.
