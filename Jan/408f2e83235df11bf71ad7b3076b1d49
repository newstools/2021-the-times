A video of grave diggers preparing seven burial sites at a Durban Muslim cemetery for people who lost their lives as a result of Covid-19  is a grim reminder of the reality of the second wave of infections in eThekwini, one of the hotspots in KwaZulu-Natal. The footage was captured on Sunday by a mourner at a cemetery in the Overport area. The video shows the grave diggers preparing seven graves while others watch. In the background, fresh graves — mainly for people who have succumbed to the coronavirus — can be seen. A mourner is heard saying all the new graves contain the remains of people who suffered Covid-related deaths in the past few weeks. “As I visited here, seven graves have been dug up. This is a lesson for us,” he said. According to the latest health department statistics, KwaZulu-Natal has recorded 4,642 deaths related to Covid-19. ​On Sunday, premier Sihle Zikalala said  there had been a number of “home deaths and people dying on arrival at health facilities, which is a clear indication people are reporting late to health facilities”. He said family cluster infections had also increased, “which clearly indicates infected family members are not complying with self-quarantine and self-isolation rules”. TimesLIVE
