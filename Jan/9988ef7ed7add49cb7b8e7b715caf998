Radio personality DJ Warras has urged  police to use their discretion when dealing with people who break the curfew. The Shady Lurker’s comments come after AfriForum’s private prosecution unit revealed  on Monday  they were looking into the case of a father who was arrested for violating the curfew while he was out to buy formula milk for his newborn baby last week. According to TimesLIVE, a Centurion father who was arrested for rushing to a nearby hospital during curfew hours to buy formula milk, is planning to sue the police service and the officers who detained him for unlawful arrest. Believing the police were unfair for arresting the new father, Warras shared his own story about  driving after curfew and questioned what he would have done if he encountered such a situation. “I left after curfew the other night to buy sanitary pads. I never encountered police but if I did, I’d like to think they would use their discretion in dealing with me and my circumstances under which I broke the rule.” Recently the DJ said the government was willing to lose billions rather than trust “weak” law enforcement. His comments came after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the ban on the sales and distribution of alcohol would remain as the level 3 lockdown was extended. In a discussion with one of his followers, the DJ explained his take on the logic behind keeping the alcohol ban. “The lifting of the ban must be accompanied by law enforcement doing their jobs. Without taking bribes and and and. Government knows they can’t take that chance. “Imagine? Knowing your enforcement is so weak — you’d rather lose billions than take a chance on them. Fu***n circus.”
