Hip hop heavyweight Cassper Nyovest is pretty certain that his nemesis AKA doesn't want to meet him in the boxing ring. The rapper shared these sentiments during a conversation with a tweep where he revealed that the boxing match contract AKA was supposed to have signed by now was going to “go back into the drawer it's been chilling nicely in for months now”. Cassper's comments come after a fan of the Supa Mega shared a snap of the rapper “about to sign” on the dotted line of the contract. While he knew the truth, Mufasa laughed off the claims that AKA was about to sign the contract, saying, “That guy doesn't want to fight. I'll believe it when the signed contract is handed in. For now, ima gonna go play Fifa with Carpo and speak gugugaga with my beautiful son.” Shortly after claiming that AKA doesn't want to fight him, Cassper realised that the tweep deleted the tweet about AKA “signing the contract”. “What did I say? Tweet deleted, tail tucked back into the ndono. All talk! No action!” Then Cassper claimed his nemesis was all about, “starting fights at clubs” and damaging his brand that he worked hard to build. “So we can both suffer at the bottom. I'm not into that. Let's get in the ring, no bodyguards to save you,” Cassper directed his comments to AKA. When asked by another tweep what it would help fighting each other, Cassper explained that it wasn't about solving anything, but him wanting AKA to feel his “wrath”, especially after he swore at his parents years ago. “I won't do it in the streets cause it'll damage my brand. I need to see him in the ring. I will never get over him swearing my queen,” he said of the reason behind opting for the boxing match. As he believes AKA is trying  to “run away” and not face him in the ring, Cassper made it known that all he wants to do is fight.
