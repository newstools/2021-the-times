Australia's most-populous state of New South Wales on Sunday reported eight new Covid-19 cases as new social distancing restrictions and mandatory mask wearing kicked in while neighbouring Victoria had three new cases. The New South Wales outbreak, which began around mid-December at Sydney's Northern Beaches, now totals 148. There are also smaller clusters in Sydney's west and south, which authorities fear could rise in coming days. NSW will enforce mask wearing from midnight in indoor venues like gaming rooms, hair salons, nail salons and retail shops.
