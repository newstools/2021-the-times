The Simpsons has once again got the Twitter TLs hot, after fans suggested that the popular TV show had predicted Kamala Harris becoming US vice-president. Harris was sworn in by US Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor on Wednesday, the court's first Latina member.

Harris became the first woman, first black American and first Asian American to hold the second-highest US office, with many believing she is an obvious contender for the presidency in 2024, should Joe Biden not serve a second term. And while The Simpsons didn't show Lisa as vice-president, according to UNILAD, a 2000 episode of the show, titled Bart To The Future, saw Lisa becoming the first female president of America, succeeding Donald Trump. Also, the outfit Lisa wore as president  looked really similar to the one worn by Harris at her inauguration ceremony. Of course, this is not the first time that The Simpsons has "predicted the future", with the show once mentioning reality show star Trump as a former president — and we all know how that one turned out. Writer Dan Greaney once told The Hollywood Reporter that showing Trump as president was “a warning to America”. “That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom.
