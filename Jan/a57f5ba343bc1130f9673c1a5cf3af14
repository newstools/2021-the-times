A video of more than a dozen mortuary and funeral parlour vans waiting outside the RK Khan Hospital in Chatsworth on Monday is being shared as a reminder of the seriousness of the pandemic in KwaZulu-Natal. The person who took the video is heard saying in Zulu there were several vehicles waiting to collect  bodies. “That video was taken yesterday [Monday], I think. The RK Khan  mortuary is absolutely full. I’m sending at least two or three vans to RK Khan every day. We are also helping them remove bodies for storage at Gale Street mortuary,” said Christopher Moodley of Pinetown Funeral Services. On Tuesday,  health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said  14,410 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, and  KwaZulu-Natal is still the virus epicentre with 71,178 active cases. Of the 513 new Covid-19 related deaths confirmed on Tuesday night, 92 were in KwaZulu-Natal. Several users who shared  the grim video commented that  it was a reminder to people of the reality of the impact of the pandemic in the province, and urged people to “stay at home”. TimesLIVE
