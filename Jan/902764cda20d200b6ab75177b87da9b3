Makes: about 4 litres Equipment needed: Large pot Large metal spoon Cheesecloth, or a fine sieve 2 x 2 litre cooldrink bottles with lids, well washed Ingredients: 12 Granny Smith apples, unpeeled and quartered without removing the cores 2 oranges, cut into quarters 1 cinnamon stick 10ml (2 tsp) cloves 5ml (1 tsp) ground allspice A knob of ginger, peeled and finely sliced 4 litres of water 125ml (½ cup) brown sugar 10ml (2 tsp) Brewer's yeast Method: • A word of caution: home brews can become undrinkable if stored incorrectly or for too long. If there is any fungal growth, if the brew tastes “off” or has an unpleasant smell beyond the yeast undertones, don't take any chances: rather throw it away. Also ensure that whatever utensils you use to home brew are scrupulously clean; sterilising them in boiling water is best. • Making your own home brew might go against the spirit of the law, but it isn't expressly prohibited by the adjusted alert level 3 lockdown regulations. Drink responsibly.
