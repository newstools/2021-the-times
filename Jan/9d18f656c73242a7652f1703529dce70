Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is expected to testify before the state capture commission on Friday. Molefe had served as CEO of another state owned entity, Transnet, before moving to the power utility. In August 2020, his former bodyguard told the state capture inquiry how he  found a backpack belonging to Molefe, half-full with bundles of R200 notes. The bodyguard - whose identity was masked and named “Witness 1" - said this happened at the Transnet offices. The backpack, he said, was the same one  Molefe used to carry on his alleged visits to the Gupta residence in Saxonwold.
