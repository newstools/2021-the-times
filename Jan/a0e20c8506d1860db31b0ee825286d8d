To avoid  a humiliating defeat, the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay is not expected  to field a  candidate when councillors elect a mayor on Thursday. The party has only 49 seats, while  the current coalition government of the DA, UDM, COPE, UF and AIC has 63. The decision not to field a candidate was taken by ANC branch chairs, secretaries and the regional task team (RTT) during a virtual meeting on Tuesday. This was after a faction of the ANC had proposed that the party nominate and support EFF councillor Amandlangawethu Madaka for the job. For more on this article, please visit HeraldLIVE.
