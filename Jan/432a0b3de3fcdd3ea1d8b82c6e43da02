Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says he is “disappointed and disgusted” in the way  his department spent R431m on sanitising schools. TimesLIVE said that a report compiled by the head of department and CFO  revealed that allegedly dodgy spending of about R431m for decontamination, disinfection and cleaning of educational facilities commenced in June 2020 in preparation for the opening of schools on June 8. The process involved 2,207 schools and 38 administration buildings. It has  been alleged that a number of companies awarded  tenders to sanitise schools did not have any expertise and experience and were not part of the cleaning industry. Speaking on the allegations in an interview on 702, Lesufi said he did not know about the amount spent. He vowed to launch a probe and that heads would roll. Here are five  quotes from his interview. Taken aback by the report “I was not aware, I only became aware when the journalist requested the information, and when I went through the report I was completely taken aback.” Disgusted, to say the least “I have taken the decision that I need to get law-enforcement agencies to dig deep and investigate this matter. I am disgusted. Whoever was responsible must know we will take appropriate action.” Accountability “As a political office, we are held accountable for things that are just sometimes far from us. There is a separate authority, there are things the operation office must do and there are things the political office must do.” Endorsement “What I knew and endorsed, was that  every school must be given a certain amount of money so that when there is a case of Covid-19, they don't have to write reports to a district office.” Unwarranted publicity “This publicity is completely unwarranted and not needed. I take full responsibility. I am responsible for this department.” On social media, users shared their shock at the news, with some saying Lesufi should face the music.
