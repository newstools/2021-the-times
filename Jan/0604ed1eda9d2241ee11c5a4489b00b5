Social media was left shooketh on Wednesday, after  reports that  China has introduced anal swabs as a new method of testing for Covid-19 that could detect the virus more accurately. According to Reuters, some cities in the country were using samples taken from the anus to detect potential Covid-19 infections as China introduced zero-tolerance Covid-19 measures  amid regional outbreaks and ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays on February 12. The news agency  said the move comes after a throat swab on a 52-year-old man in Weinan showed negative results despite him  displaying symptoms such as coughing and appetite loss.
