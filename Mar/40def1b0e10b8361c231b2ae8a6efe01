After years of hard work and overcoming many challenges, the Mrs SA organisation will crown the new Mrs SA on March 18. The Mrs SA Grand Finale promises to be a spectacular hybrid event, comprising a live stream broadcast from Studio Iris that you can watch right here on the Sunday Times website, and a VIP viewing experience at Emperors Palace. The production focuses on the 25 women who have walked this journey for the past 14 months, and successfully so during a pandemic – a testament to the resilience of SA women. The show will feature former Mrs SA and Survivor SA star Nicole Capper, as the master of ceremonies as well as former Mrs SA title holders as part of the judging panel to highlight the sisterhood and women empowerment platform the organisation has come to be known for. The judging panel is headed up by philanthropist and businesswoman Matapa Maila, who held the title in 2019, along with female entrepreneurs Olwethu Ndoda, Aldytha da Silva, and reigning queen Jacqueline Ferns. Well-known SA businessman Vusi Zwane, will join the otherwise all-female panel as a guest judge on the night of the finale. The judging process is overseen by independent auditors from BDO SA. The Mrs SA brand showcases the virtues of SA, the spirit of ubuntu, and the modern woman who is relatable and lives life in full colour. Mrs SA aims to share real local stories, showcase true beauty that shines from within, and celebrate and empower every SA woman to be the best version of herself. The new queen will become an ambassador for the organisation and its sponsors, and represent SA at Mrs World. For more information, visit the Mrs SA website.
