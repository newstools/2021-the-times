Actor Aaron Moloisi has taken to social media to shut down rumours about his relationship with Somizi's husband Mohale Motaung-Mhlongo. As speculation continues to swirl about the future of Somizi and Mohale's marriage, a picture of Aaron alongside a mystery man that many believed looked like Mohale was shared online. Soon the actor's name was on the Twitter trends list as users debated the snap. Aaron took to Instagram to share the truth behind the photo. He made it clear: the man was not Mohale. “After years of speculation and assumptions of the person in the image I posted on  October 17 2018, taken in Cape Town, SA. I have decided to settle this issue once and for all, The person in the picture is not Mohale Motaung-Mhlongo,” said Aaron. The media personality also spoke out against hate and said he wouldn't stand in the way of other people's happiness. “I’ve always advocated for loving differently and will never participate in karma that goes against seeing other people happy,” he wrote. In a recent interview with True Love magazine, Somizi and Mohale rubbished claims they had split. “Mohale and I have never split up, but we have challenges just like any other couple out there. We’re fortunate that we have other homes to retreat to when we choose not to be in the same space, so we either go to our home in the Vaal or Zimbali,” Somizi told the publication.
