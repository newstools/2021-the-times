Not many people get the chance to spend a few weeks basking in the sun, chilling with a bunch of the sexiest, most fun people in SA. If this sounds like your vibe, waste no time in applying for Temptation Island SA. You don’t have to be single — if you’re in a committed relationship that feels like it’s at a crossroads, this reality show will prove whether you’re meant to be together forever, or should rather throw in the towel (and the bikini). The ultimate relationship test, Temptation Island follows four couples at a pivotal time in their relationship, where they must decide if they are ready to commit to one another for the rest of their lives — or go their separate ways. Together, the couples experience the ultimate holiday in paradise, where they join single men and women, all looking for love. There, they live the “single life,” in a test that is meant to help answer their most difficult questions about their relationship. Couples and singles who’d like to throw their sun hats in the ring for this incredible opportunity, should submit their entries on the Temptation Island website. You have to be over 21 and a permanent resident of SA to enter. Naturally, you also have to be ready to drop everything to spend time getting to know some fascinating new people and having the experience of a lifetime. Entries close on March 31 2021.
