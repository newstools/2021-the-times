Talk about the country's possible return to level 2 lockdown has Mzansi shaking in its boots, sparking rumours about a 21-day booze ban that have since been dismissed by the government. This comes after Prof Salim Abdool Karim, the co-chair of the ministerial advisory committee (MAC), called for the government to move SA to alert level 2 before the  Easter holiday as a precautionary measure. Speaking to TimesLIVE, Abdool Karim said moving to level 2 lockdown before the upcoming long weekend could minimise the risk of a third Covid-19 wave. “I don’t know if we will have a third wave after Easter. But I don't want to wait to find out. I would rather take the precautions and reduce our chances of a third wave,” he said. “I think if we did those activities we would reduce the risk of super-spreading events like what happened with the second wave, which hit us badly because of such events. This time we want to avoid the risk of super-spreading events.” According to a News24 report, the national command council (NCC) was advised last week in a MAC advisory to restrict gatherings to 50, impose a 10pm curfew and revert to selling alcohol only from Mondays to Thursdays from 10am to 6pm. The publication said the NCC was expected to meet on Thursday. Over the Easter weekend last year, the country saw a dramatic drop in the number of traffic violations. Road accidents declined by 83%, and only 26 fatal crashes were recorded, which resulted in 28 fatalities on SA roads during the period. However, transport minister Fikile Mbalula noted that comparing last  year's statistics with previous years was not realistic as the lockdown had drastically limited movement on the roads. This is what level 2 looked like last year, according to the government gazette. However, there have been various amendments made to all lockdowns levels.
