Glebelands Hostel “hitman” Senzo Sihle Cele was convicted of four counts of murder by the Pietermaritzburg high court this week. The hostel in Umlazi, south Durban, has been engulfed  in violence in recent years, with one activist saying  more than 100 people have been murdered at the hostel or in violence linked to it and its power  struggles. Police said a task team was formed to investigate the killings and many suspects involved were being put behind  bars. Cele was the latest when he was convicted on Wednesday . The  convictions relate to the murders of Simphiwe Ndebele, who was shot  dead at Glebelands after an argument with Cele, and  Siyabonga Mbhele, who was shot and killed at KwaMnyandu taxi rank. Cele, 30, was also convicted of the double murder of Joseph Nqaba Mbhele and Senzo Luthuli, who were also shot and killed at KwaMnyandu taxi rank. Police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele said  following the murders, which occurred during July and October 2018, a lengthy investigation was conducted. “The investigation led to the arrest of the accused. During his arrest in 2018, the accused was found in possession of a pistol with 35 rounds of ammunition. He made several court appearances and was found guilty,” Mbele said. The court also found Cele guilty of unlawful possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition. The matter was postponed until next Tuesday for sentencing proceedings, the National Prosecuting Authority said. “This is a victory for us and we are hoping a harsher sentence will be handed down in court,” said acting KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Maj-Gen Thulani Gonya.
