The Comité Champagne (safeguards of the collective interests of Champagne growers and houses) has launched the Champagne MOOC (massive open online course), the reference tool when it comes to Champagne education. It’s open to everyone and available 24/7. Everything you need to know about this great wine is right here in this MOOC, presented in four interactive learning modules: The Champagne MOOC is available in French and English, and takes less than five hours to complete, consisting of more than 40 short videos. The English version of the videos offers subtitles in seven languages (Chinese, English, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian and Spanish). It allows you to work at your own pace and test your knowledge along the way using the quizzes at the end of each sequence. For an extra €49, you can access the premium version, allowing you to get the MOOC statement of completion (subject to passing the quizzes and only available in English and French) and with it, additional course content.
