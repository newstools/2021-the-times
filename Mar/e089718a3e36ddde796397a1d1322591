The Planete Sauvage zoological park in Port-Saint-Pere, western France, recently welcomed a baby red howler monkey in a boost to conservation efforts for the threatened species. Howler monkeys are native to South and Central American forests. They get their name from the loud vocalisations produced by both male and females. The sounds of their howls can travel 5km through dense rain forest.
