Nigerian soldiers opened fire in the town of Jangebe as 279 schoolgirls who had been kidnapped in northwest Nigeria were being returned to their families on Wednesday, a day after their release, according to two Reuters witnesses. At least three people were injured, the witnesses said. It was not immediately clear why the soldiers began shooting.
