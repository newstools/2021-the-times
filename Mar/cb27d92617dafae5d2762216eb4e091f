For nearly a year, Azalet Dube has been criss-crossing communities in Gauteng, spreading the truth about Covid-19. And on International Women's Day on Monday, the 55-year-old's efforts were praised when President Cyril Ramaphosa mentioned her by name in his weekly newsletter. Dube said she felt honoured and special to have been recognised by the president. People who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can meet without masks indoors in small groups with others who have been inoculated but should avoid non-essential travel and continue to wear face-coverings in public, the Biden administration said on Monday. In a long-awaited update of its guidance for behaviors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said fully vaccinated people could also meet in small groups with unvaccinated individuals deemed at low-risk for severe Covid-19 from one other household without masks. The slight lifting of restrictions represented a still cautious approach to public health guidance despite the quickly growing number of vaccinated people. President Joe Biden has urged Americans to remain vigilant and continue to follow CDC guidelines to prevent another surge of cases. Reuters
