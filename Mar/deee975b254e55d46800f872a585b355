Former Eskom group CEO Brian Molefe returned to the state capture inquiry on March 2 and 3 2021 to complete his testimony regarding his tenure at the embattled state power utility. During a recap of previous proceedings, Molefe again brought forward allegations against President Cyril Ramaphosa and his supposed relationship with mining companies Glencore and Optimum. “He would have financial benefit; he would have an interest in the settlement of the penalties. I’m not saying I know he peddled influence but the situation was likely to arise,” Molefe says. Molefe denied having a relationship with the Gupta family or their associates, or receiving  a boost for his elevation to parliament. Molefe returns to the commission to deliver Transnet-related evidence on Monday March 8.
