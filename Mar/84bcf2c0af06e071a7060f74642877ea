Former Eskom and Transnet boss Brian Molefe had South Africans talking on social media after his testimony at the state capture  inquiry on Monday. Molefe was quizzed about his relationship with the controversial Gupta family and their alleged influence in his appointment as CEO of Eskom and Transnet. Molefe, who admitted to knowing the Guptas “well” and regularly visiting their Saxonwold compound, was asked by evidence leader advocate Anton Myburgh whether he felt betrayed by the Guptas when they fled SA as allegations of crime mounted against them. He said he felt betrayed by former public protector Thuli Madonsela because she failed to protect him, but he did not feel betrayed by the Guptas. “I feel  I was done in by the public protector, the person who was supposed to protect me from this onslaught that happened in the absence of evidence,” he said. Asked how many times he had gone to the Gupta compound, he responded: “I don’t know. Numerous times. I can’t remember. It was eight or nine years ago.” Molefe told inquiry chairperson deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo: “There was a live issue  we had reason to discuss, which was the formation of the bank or the purchase of a bank.  We had tried to do it before I went to Transnet and after I had left, there would be an occasion to talk about a development.” He said Madonsela “opened fire” on everyone who went to the Gupta residence without asking why they were there. He said he would only feel betrayed by the Guptas when there is conclusive evidence supporting the allegations against them. Here are some of the reactions to his testimony:
