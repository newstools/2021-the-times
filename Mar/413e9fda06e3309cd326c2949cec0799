The country's head of the ministerial advisory committee (MAC) on Covid-19, Salim Abdool Karim, stepped down from his position a few days ago to refocus  his time on science and research. Sunday Times sat down with the professor for a last catchup on Covid-19 and to find out what is next. Abdool Karim  scotched rumours that his decision to step down was  due to conflict between himself and health minister Zweli Mkhize and within the  MAC. He also shared his concerns about a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections in the next few weeks as a result of possible gatherings during the Easter period. Abdool Karim recalled being appointed as the head of the MAC by  Mkhize. “I was going to do it, he didn't need to ask me.” He  explained however that he “can't continue” in this role as he felt he was  neglecting his academic positions and research.  He added that he would  always be available for advice on Covid-19  despite stepping down. TimesLIVE
