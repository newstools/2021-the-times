Speaking to TshisaLIVE, the Fake it 'Til You Make It reality show star revealed that he had bought his partner a plane ticket to Cape Town, only to bump into him later at the club in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. He was open about the “betrayal”, saying that he wants to be frank with his fans about the realities of his heartbreak. “The reason I’m being transparent with people is that I am quite tired of sugar-coating things, claiming how I am sad because of the ‘long distance’ while I’m out here looking like a crybaby. I wanted people to understand why I’m crying,” said Lasizwe.
