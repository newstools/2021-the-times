Wierzycka will remain involved in the company as a non-executive director, the company said. David Hufton, who currently shares the role with her, will assume the role of sole CEO on June 1. “After successfully leading Sygnia since its inception in 2006, Ms Wierzycka will continue to play a key role in shaping the strategic direction of the company together with its executive team and the board of directors.
