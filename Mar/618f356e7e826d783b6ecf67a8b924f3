This week Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha's infamous relationship  again became a topic of conversation after the gqom queen's most recent interview. Speaking to MacG on his podcast, the star opened up on her various beefs with other celebs, her partying lifestyle and managing her finances after making bank on her hit single Wololo.
