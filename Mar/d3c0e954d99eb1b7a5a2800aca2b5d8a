A cash van was blown up and robbed in Boksburg on the East Rand on Monday by a gang driving luxury vehicles. National police spokesperson Brenda Muridili said the incident happened at 9.30 on Atlas Road. Muridili said the cash van was rammed off the road by a green Mercedes-Benz. “An unknown number of suspects robbed the security guards of an undisclosed amount of money after allegedly using explosives to bomb the armoured vehicle.” Muridili said they fled the scene in a white Mercedes-Benz and black Audi. She said two security guards were taken to hospital after they sustained minor injuries.
