Johannesburg Water said on Tuesday that bulk water supplier Rand Water was expected to complete repairs at the Palmiet booster pumping station on Thursday, resolving some of the water woes that have been experienced in recent days. Three medium-voltage pumps exploded at the pumping station in Alberton  on Sunday, rendering the station inoperable. Palmiet is one of three satellite booster stations that supplies reservoirs located through the Rand Water's areas of supply. It is from these reservoirs that water is delivered to its customers. However, while the Joburg Water statement will come as relief, Rand Water spokesperson Justice Mohale said the entity had not yet given an estimate of time frames for repairs. He said the entity was surprised at the Joburg Water announcement. Mohale referred TimesLIVE to their statement, which read: “One of the three damaged voltage motors have been replaced already, which lead to an increase in pumping. We are receiving reports that water supply has been restored to some areas.” On Tuesday, Joburg Water said the South Hills tower and Midrand reservoirs were still under enormous strain since the explosion. “Rand Water has been able to repair some of the electrical switch gears which has assisted to boost pumping, but it is still not at full capacity. Our bulk supplier has indicated that repairs should be completed on Thursday. “We have arranged for additional water tankers in the affected areas, a comprehensive list of the position of the tankers and regular updates can be found on our social pages and website,” Joburg Water said. The Joburg Water statement included the affected areas and the placement of water tankers. TimesLIVE
