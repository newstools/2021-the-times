Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he hoped those who accused him of influencing the awarding of a R30m tender to In2IT Technologies would “do the honourable thing” after deputy public protector Kholeka Gcaleka found that there was no wrongdoing on his part. “I just hope those who insulted me and even laid a criminal case with the police will do the honourable thing,” Lesufi wrote on his Twitter page. The public protector’s office had in 2020 received a complaint from Adv Anton Alberts who alleged that Lesufi might have unduly influenced the award of the R30m tender to In2IT Technologies, considering that he allegedly, on several occasions tried to “insert” In2IT Technologies into government services. Alberts  alleged that: Gcaleka said the allegation that Lesufi unduly influenced the awarding of the tender to In2IT was unsubstantiated. “There is no evidence in my possession that indicates that Mr Lesufi was involved in any procurement process of the SOC tender or that he disregarded the provisions of the code of conduct for members of the provincial executive council. “The conduct of Mr Lesufi was not in contravention of section 136 (1) (2) (a) (b) (c) of the constitution and rule 9 of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature standing rules,” Gcaleka said.
