The vaccine rollout programme for police officers kicked off on July 5 and has exceeded the 20,000 mark. According to police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe, 23,375 police officers and personnel, including cleaners and security staff, have been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in eight provinces. SABC News reported that Mathe said because of the unrest in KwaZulu-Natal, the vaccine rollout for police personnel in the province has been delayed. “The situation in KwaZulu-Natal demanded the immediate response and maximum mobilisation of members and resources, hence the delay in the rollout of the vaccination programme,” said Mathe. Reacting to the video, many laughed at the officer, while others said they could relate. Here is a snapshot of some of the reactions.
