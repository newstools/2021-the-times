Your special signature walk, swinging your arms to the back! So many memories!” she wrote. In the tribute to Moses,  Connie said her brother had experienced pain and discomfort before his passing. “I love you big bro. I will never forget you. I’m sorry your last moments on this earth were so painful and uncomfortable! Rest now. God has taken that pain away. You join the angels that advocate for us daily on the other side.”
