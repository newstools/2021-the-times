After 50 matches, across 11 European cities, the Uefa Euro 2020 is coming to an end as Italy and England face off in the finals at Wembley Stadium this Sunday, July 11 at 10pm. The final will be live-streamed across Africa on Showmax Pro, courtesy of SuperSport. The month-long tournament has delivered spectacular football action of mind-blowing goals, nail-biting moments, drama and surprises that saw some big nations fall at the hands of tournament underdogs. In perhaps the biggest shocker, world champions France, who had been predicted as a likely winner of the Euro 2020, were kicked out by Switzerland in a tense penalty shoot-out, while the Netherlands side, who entered the round of 16 with an all-win record, lost at home to Czech Republic. More surprises followed when defending champions Portugal fell to top-ranked Belgium, who met the same fate at the quarterfinals against the current title contender, Italy. In the first semifinals on Tuesday, Italy triumphed against Spain in an intense match that ended in an even more dramatic penalty shoot-out. The second semifinal on Wednesday was no different as England beat Denmark 2-1 in extra time to book their spot in the Euro finals for the first time ever. Highlights from all matches are available on Showmax Pro. Now it all comes down to the final showdown on Sunday, with Italy looking for their second Euro win in 53 years while England, with their home advantage at Wembley, will be fighting to make history and end their 55-year trophy drought.
