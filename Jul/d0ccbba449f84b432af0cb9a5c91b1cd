The case against  a politician accused of inciting violence in Gauteng  has been postponed to July 26 for verification of information. Bruce Nimmerhoudt, who is a leader of the Patriotic Alliance (PA) on the West Rand and also a mayoral candidate for the party in a West Rand municipality, appeared briefly in the Roodepoort magistrateâ€™s court on Monday morning. On Thursday evening there was a voice note circulating on WhatsApp inciting people on the West Rand to join the violence experienced in other parts of  Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. It is alleged  Nimmerhoudt was behind the voice note. The state is opposing his bail. Among other things, the state told the court it was  looking for other devices  allegedly used to  incite violence. The state  said further arrests might be compromised if Nimmerhoudt is granted bail. The defence told the court Nimmerhoudt cooperated with the police and unlocked all his devices for law enforcement officials. PA deputy president Kenny Kunene told reporters outside  court that Nimmerhoudt only instructed PA forces to be prepared to defend infrastructure from looters. In a series of tweets, party president Gayton McKenzie also proclaimed  Nimmerhoudt  was innocent. On Friday, the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NatJoints), which is co-chaired by the military, police and State Security Agency, called for people to refrain from inciting violence by creating and circulating inflammatory messages that seek to do nothing but elevate the levels of tension, confusion and fear among communities. NatJoints said it has mobilised  resources to address the threats and heighten visibility. TimesLIVE
