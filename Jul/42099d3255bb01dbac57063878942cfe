A video of a gogo "disappearing" on camera has gone viral, leading to several hilarious jokes and memes. As looting and riots broke out in parts of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng this week, social media users noticed the woman "fading away" in the background of a SABC News interview with a taxi association chairmperson. "Where does the Gogo at the back disappear to?", asked one user, playfully.

While many pointed this out, others took hold of the light-hearted moment and ran with it. Here are some of the hilarious comments and memes shared:
