Taking to her Instagram, Brenda posted a video of herself singing Thina Sizwe, the  song  Zuma sang at former President Nelson Mandela's funeral. The singer said she was saying  a prayer for uBaba, as he's affectionally called by his supporters, because something about his arrest didn't feel “right”. “Siyakhuleka ubaba uMsholozi aphile (we are praying  Msholozi lives through this). Something is not feeling right with him in jail. I feel sad for some reason.” Uzalo actress Gugu also used her platform to show support for Msholozi, saying  he's done the same for family in past times. Gugu knows the former president personally as her mother Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi is a former  parliamentarian and politician. “Nxamalala, our family will always appreciate the emotional support you gave us during and after my Mom’s ailment. Those visits and check-ups went a long way. When many turned their backs on us, you did not. This will forever be a testament of your character. Yima njalo Msholozi,” she wrote. In a now deleted post, Kelly Khumalo's sister and Afro-pop singer Zandie  also took a moment to wish Msholozi strength. “I'm sorry baba, I can only imagine what your children are going through. Be strong and may God be with your family,” said the singer.
