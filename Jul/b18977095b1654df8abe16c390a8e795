Cape Town metro has moved from fears of day zero to huge increases in its dam levels, as winter rains in recent weeks saw huge improvements. The latest average dam level for dams in the Western Cape is 67.8% (2020: 45%) while the latest average level for dams providing water to the City of Cape Town is 90% (2020: 63%), the provincial government said in statement. Rainfall in the past week has seen the average level for the province increase from 55% to nearly 68%. Levels of large dams like the Clanwilliam Dam have increased from 23.6% to 74% in one week. Anton Bredell, the minister of local government, environmental affairs and development planning in the Western Cape, says the past week has seen large volumes of water flowing towards provincial dams. “Three years ago at this time, the City of Cape Town was at the end of a devastating drought with dam levels low following a threat of a day zero event in the metro. This week the dams providing water to the metro have seen their levels increase from an average of 75% to 90%, an incredible number in a very short period.” Bredell has urged consumers to continue to use water sparingly despite the fuller dams. “Water will always be a scarce resource and we must adjust our behaviour change permanently. We need to do more with less. Overall, across the province, we are fortunate to be in the position we are in at the moment but we always need to look ahead and plan for the future. In addition, we remain concerned as always about the Gouritz River catchment area and we hope to see some relief in that region too.” Major dam statistics: TimesLIVE
