Letsholonyane‚ who announced his retirement on Thursday‚ left SuperSport in 2019-20‚ going on to have a one-year stint with the now-defunct Highlands Park before ending the 2020-21 season on the books of TS Galaxy‚ where he only made 11 league appearances. He announced his retirement with a classy video displaying the jerseys of his career‚ including the national team. Letsholonyane played 54 matches for Bafana and scored two goals.
