More than 180,000 children have tested positive for Covid-19 in SA since March last year. The latest surveillance report from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) found that 184,187 South Africans under the age of 19 had tested positive for the coronavirus from March 1 last year to June 19 this year. “ June 19 2021, individuals aged under 19 years made up 13.4% of SARS-CoV-2 tests, 10.2% of laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases, 4.2% of all Covid-19-associated admissions and 0.7% of deaths associated with Covid-19,” the report stated. You can get Covid-19 even after receiving the vaccine. This has become one of the main concerns among South Africans as the country continues to battle the third wave of infections. Medical experts agree that not every Covid-19-positive patient requires oxygen. Dr Angelique Coetzee, of the South African Medical Association (Sama), has also warned against the growing trend of people self-prescribing oxygen. By doing this, those needing it in hospital might not be able to get it, she said. “The problem is that those who don’t require oxygen stockpile it and that affects the supply, with hospitals ending up not having enough for the patients who need it,” she said. This sentiment was echoed by Olivedale Hospital pulmonologist Dr Frans Skosana, who said oxygen is a drug that needs to be prescribed and monitored. “It doesn’t treat Covid, [it’s] just additional support.” The conflict between the health department and newly qualified doctors over their internship placements could soon play out in court.
