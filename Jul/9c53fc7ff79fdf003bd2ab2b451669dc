A further 31 athletes from seven disciplines were named to Team SA on Saturday, taking the overall number of Olympic competitors to 164 so far. That officially lifted the total number beyond 138, the size of SA’s previous-largest Olympic contingent that went to Rio 2016. The SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) said in a statement it expected the team to reach around 180, once the final athletes, swimmers and golfers were added to the mix. Garrick Higgo and Christiaan Bezuidenhout will compete in the men’s competition, but only Ashleigh Buhai was named for the women’s tournament. A second golfer is to be confirmed. The team will also feature two equestrian competitors and a judoka. Diver Julia Vincent and open-water swimmer Michelle Weber are Olympic veterans, having competed in Rio. The men’s football team was also announced.
