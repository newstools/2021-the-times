Jacob Zuma's younger brother, Michael Zuma, has died  after a long illness. Sources close to the family confirmed to TimesLIVE on Sunday afternoon that Michael died at around 11am. Zuma's 77-year-old brother Khanya confirmed Michael's death. “He was old. He had not been OK for many years. He was younger than me and JZ. There is a dark cloud. I am going to Mike's house now. I am sure they have told JZ already,” said Khanya. When Zuma was imprisoned on Thursday,  Khanya, told TimesLIVE: “Our brother Michael is also not well. He is bedridden and delirious now. He too doesn’t know what is going on.” TimesLIVE
