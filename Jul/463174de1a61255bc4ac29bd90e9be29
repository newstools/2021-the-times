Minister of justice and correctional services Ronald Lamola is on Thursday giving plans put in place by the department to prepare for the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma. The former statesman handed himself over just before midnight on Wednesday and was admitted at the Estcourt Correctional Centre in KwaZulu-Natal.
