Companies should find a reasonable resolution that accommodates all parties  when employees refuse to be vaccinated on medical or constitutional grounds. This is according to employment and labour minister Thulas Nxesi, who issued new directives for workplace vaccinations this week. Nxesi said this formed part of the new consolidated direction on occupational health and safety measures in certain workplaces. Sunday Times last month reported that businesses, labour and government reached an agreement at Nedlac regarding  workplace Covid-19 vaccine guidelines. Employees will be encouraged to get their jabs and will be given paid time off to do so, but cannot be dismissed for declining the vaccination. Employees can refuse to get be vaccinated on constitutional grounds  as part of their right to bodily integrity in section 12(2) and the right to freedom of religion, belief and opinion in section 13 of the constitution. Nxesi said medical grounds refer to issues of an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose or a diagnosed allergy to a component of the Covid-19 vaccine. He said a mandatory vaccination policy can only be included in a company’s risk assessment plan by doing the following three-step  inquiry: Nxesi said given the phased nature of the national vaccination programme based on criteria, employers can only require employees to be vaccinated once they become eligible and have been registered on the electronic vaccination data system (EVDS) and given a date for vaccination. “What is critical is that we need to balance the needs and  take into account the dictates of collective bargaining and the need to keep employees healthy and businesses running. The Labour Relations Act emphasises the primacy of collective agreements. “These guidelines are not intended as a substitute for collective agreements or agreed procedures between employers, their employer organisations and trade unions,” said Nxesi.
