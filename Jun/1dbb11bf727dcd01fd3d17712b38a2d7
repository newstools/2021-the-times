A police officer attached to the Limpopo Hawks office is in hot water after his nephew  allegedly shot himself in the head with the officer’s  service gun. The incident happened on Monday afternoon in Shayandima, Thohoyandou. Limpopo police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said the 13-year-old boy allegedly came across the gun after his uncle  left it lying unattended in a room. The child  allegedly “accessed his uncle’s firearm  and shot himself  in the head”, Mojapelo told TimesLIVE. “He died instantly. It is not clear at this stage whether the child accidentally shot himself or took his own life. An inquest has been opened and investigations continue.” The warrant officer, 43, faces a charge of negligent keeping of a firearm in contravention of the Firearms Control Act. He will also face an investigation into his fitness to possess a firearm. Limpopo  police commissioner Lt-Gen Thembi Hadebe said  a firearm “may not be kept anywhere except in a locked safe or carried in a holster  worn by or attached to the person of the holder when it is not in use”. “The member will  be dealt with accordingly,” she said.
