The Estate's Dineo Langa noted how in the past it hasn't been safe for her loved ones and it appears as if this is still the case. “There was a period in the 90s where the deaths of queer lives were in the multitudes. This year is feeling like the resurgence of that. It's shattering to think how so many of those lives that I hold dear to me aren't safe in these times, fact is they never were,” said Dineo.
