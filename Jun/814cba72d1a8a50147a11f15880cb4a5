The musician slammed such people, telling them to mind their own business and stop making the gym a stressful place for people who were  trying to better their health and fitness. “If you see someone out of shape trying to  lose weight, mind your business, stop staring. That person is dealing with a lot as it is,” Kaybee said. Prince Kaybee may spend a lot of time in studio creating hit songs, but the DJ never neglects his health or fitness.
