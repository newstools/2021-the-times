The Gauteng coronavirus command council led by premier David Makhura is expected to brief the media on Thursday. This comes after the province recorded a record high 10,800 new cases on Wednesday. The council is expected to also give an update on Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic hospital which was closed in April after a fire.
