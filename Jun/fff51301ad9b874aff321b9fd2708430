Musician Shimza has called out the “exclusivity” of Afro and house music, saying that by not making the genre accessible for all, the bigger arts and music industry is negatively affected and that is bad for the culture. Taking to Twitter, the star called out mainstream venues for not playing Afro and house music. With many considering it a genre only a few indulge in, Shimza believes this has been bad for the culture. The Congo Congo star said the practice had lead to Afro and house DJs having to use amapiano music so they can cater more to listeners even when it isn’t their usual type of music. “Mainstream venues hardly play Afro and house. It has become ‘exclusive’ and that’s not good for the culture. We end up having to create and play amapiano bootlegs and vocals so we can make sense. “Only a few artists and DJs who don’t do amapiano are working in SA,” said Shimza. Fans took to the reply section to share their thoughts about Afro and house music, with many standing by the genre and believing will not go out of style any time soon. However, there were some naysayers in the crowd. Check out the reactions below: Shimza was also trending at the top of the charts on Sunday night after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced SA has moved to level 4 of the lockdown, prohibiting any kind of gathering. The announcement  led to many speculating Shimza will be making top dollar once more, thanks to the Lockdown House Party concept he and PH launched during the initial lockdown level 5 in 2020 on Channel O alongside DJ PH. Responding to fans’ reactions, the star said he hopes to bring the heat with Mzansi’s hottest DJs. “Lockdown House Party is part of our Covid-19 journey. I will try, let’s cross fingers,” said Shimza.
