A woman who the health department says is 119 years old has become the oldest person in SA to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. Nomamelika Philiso received her vaccine at her home in Mandleni, Alfred Nzo municipality, in the Eastern Cape, the health ministry announced on Monday. A senior community nurse, Thobeka Ludidi,  administered the shot to the centenarian. She was screened before being given her first shot of the Pfizer vaccine. Â She is scheduled to receive the second shot in a few weeks. The health ministry showed an image of Philiso getting her shot. Wrapped in a thick blanket as she sat on her couch with her mask on, the elderly woman offered her arm for the injection. She is one of over a million people who have received the vaccine thus far. The health ministry is on a drive to vaccinate people over the age 60 against the virus. TimesLIVE
