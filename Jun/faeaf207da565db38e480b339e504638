Public works and infrastructure minister Patricia de Lille has tested positive for Covid-19, she said on Sunday. She took the test on Friday after showing some symptoms. The minister said she is in self-quarantine, and has informed everyone she has come into contact with to do the same. De Lille encouraged all South Africans to observe hygiene protocols to combat Covid-19, as the country tries to combat the third wave of infections. “As we enter wave three of the pandemic, I call on all South Africans not to let their guard down,” said De Lille in a statement. “Keep wearing your mask correctly, covering your nose and mouth. Wash or sanitise your hands regularly. Together we can beat this virus.” Earlier this month, De Lille was in parliament for her department's budget vote, during which she spelt out how spending would be trimmed amid the country's struggling economy. On May 30, she was in Mitchells Plain, campaigning for her  Good party. The minister lost her husband, Edwin, after a long illness in February. The pair were married for 49 years.
