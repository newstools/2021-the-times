Mexican Sergio Perez won a dramatic stopped and restarted Azerbaijan Grand Prix for Red Bull on Sunday after a tyre blowout denied team mate Max Verstappen victory and Lewis Hamilton failed to score. Verstappen, whose crash halted the race with two laps remaining, kept his four-point championship lead over Mercedesâ€™ Hamilton after the seven-time world champion ran off the track at the restart. Sebastian Vettel finished second for Aston Martin and Pierre Gasly third for AlphaTauri.
