The new Zulu  king has spoken out, saying the royal family and the Zulu nation will  reunite. King Misuzulu kaZwelithini Zulu — whose name means “strengthening the Zulus” — has broken his silence  after his dramatic  succession to the throne  after the death of his mother, Queen Regent Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, and father, King BhekuZulu Zwelithini, within weeks of each other. Speaking on eNCA in an interview broadcast on Wednesday, the king, who is yet to be  crowned, suggested that he was not surprised by the drama  that unfolded after he was named successor  to the throne. “When somebody passes away in the family, whether it’s the head of the house, or the queen, I was expecting a lot of great challenges and great confusion,” he said. “My charity will begin at home and I do believe that my family will come back to be one,” the new king added. While his succession to the throne was publicly disputed by some members of the royal house, the prince said he harboured no bad blood with those who were challenging this. “I don’t have anybody in my family  who I can say I dislike for any reason. I do believe in my family. I am here as part of my family and I will bring my family together to be able to show the Zulu people that unity within the family needs to begin at home. I am looking at unifying the Zulu nation as a whole. It’s a great responsibility but I think I am ready, working together with my  headmen,” he said. “We are going through a crisis ... I have to admit ... But we will get over it in time.” TimesLIVE
