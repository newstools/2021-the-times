As Covid-19 infections are again on the rise, the SA Medical Association (Sama) on Monday called for the government to impose stronger lockdown regulations. For the past few days, the country has been recording about 5,000 new infections each day. Sama chairperson Dr Angelique Coetzee said stricter curfew restrictions were needed, especially at weekends. Senegal could start manufacturing Covid vaccines as soon as next year, as part of a global push to boost vaccine production in Africa. Rare side effects have been analysed among the first 288,368 healthcare workers given the J&J vaccine in SA under the Sisonke implementation study, from February 17 to April 12, and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It’s official — teaching and non-teaching staff above the age of 40 will be the first in the education sector to be vaccinated against Covid-19. This is according to a presentation made by the acting director-general of basic education, Granville Whittle, to teacher unions on Friday.
