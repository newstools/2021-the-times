Power utility Eskom announced on Tuesday that stage 2 load-shedding would be in place from 5pm to 10pm. This was due to “delays in returning generating units at Kusile and Majuba power stations”, Eskom said in a statement. Eskom said  the “high winter demand brought about by colder temperatures” had also played a role. It also warned that the chance of rotational power cuts continuing through the week was “high”.
