The organisation said awareness must be raised to curb incidents of irresponsible alcohol consumption. “Appropriate attention should be given to the prevention of the initiation of drinking among children and adolescents, prevention of drinking among pregnant women and women of childbearing age, and protection of people from pressures to drink, especially in societies with high levels of alcohol consumption where heavy drinkers are encouraged to drink even more,” said the organisation. Van Damme questioned what she called the policing of women's bodies, saying men should also take responsibility for their health.
