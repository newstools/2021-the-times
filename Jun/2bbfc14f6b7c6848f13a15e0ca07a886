He calls himself Mbaks or Mbaweezy. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula took to Twitter this week, urging South Africans to wear masks and sanitise hands. He also shared a video clip of a singer raising awareness about Covid-19. When asked by his followers why the vaccine rollout was so slow, he responded: "There are people who die from Covid while on a vaccine." This was naturally met with outrage, and Mbalula quickly deleted his response. But it had already been screen-grabbed for evidence. How could a member of the Coronavirus Command Council justify giving so much ammunition to anti-vaxxers and their crazy theories? Can the adults in the room please take away his phone?
