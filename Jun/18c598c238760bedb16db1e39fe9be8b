Socialite and dancer Zodwa Wabantu was touched  after a fan came up to her to pray with her when she least expected it. Taking to social media, the star said  she met the Zodwa stan in a filling station. She said the man came up to her and asked if she could pray with him. The star questioned whether this was a sign from a higher power and if this had anything to do with her own spirituality. Having previously shared that her faith in the higher being is “average”, the reality TV star questioned whether the moment was divine intervention. “We were both filling up with petrol. He said, ‘Can I pray for you?’ I don’t know him. Is it God trying to say something or God is everywhere? Sign of spiritual power within me, talk to me” she wrote. In the video, Zodwa and the man can be heard reciting a Christian prayer. “Father God, in the mighty name of Jesus, I accept Jesus as my lord and personal saviour. Lord, I love you and I appreciate you. Thank you for what you are doing in my life in Jesus' mighty name, I pray. Amen,” they said. Watch the video below: Zodwa often comes across people in her daily life who  have an affect on her. Earlier this year, the star decided to help empower a young woman by paying her  to do her hair. In a video shared on Instagram, the star said she paid the woman R500 for her services so she could purchase essential items. She said she hopes that by helping, she would keep the young man “off men” who may have offered her the money. “[I] called a young girl and asked, ‘Do you know how to braid’? The R500 she can take  home and buy herself pads, roll-on [deodorant], airtime,” wrote Zodwa.
