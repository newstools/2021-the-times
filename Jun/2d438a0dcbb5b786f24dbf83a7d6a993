The internet has come for singer-songwriter Usher after his comments on T-Pain using auto-tune in his music supposedly sent the rapper into a four-year-long depression. In a preview for an episode of the new Netflix series This Is Pop, documenting some of the most pivotal moments in music history, Bartender hitmaker T-Pain opened up about allegedly being triggered by Usher into a severe and lengthy  depression. T-Pain said that one day, Usher pulled the star aside with concern about his use of auto-tune, saying that he negatively affected the music industry. “He was like, 'man, I wanna tell you something, man.' And I'm like, 'What's good?' I thought he was about to tell me something real ... he sounded real concerned,” T-Pain said. “And then he was like, 'Yeah man you kinda f***** up music,'" Pain remembered. “I didn't understand. Usher was my friend. He was like, 'Nah, you really f***** up music for real singers.'” The star said  this heart-to-heart with Usher had dire consequences for  his mental health. “And that is the very moment ... that started a four-year depression for me,” said T-Pain. Catching wind of the news, Twitter took to the streets to lambaste Usher's comments and show their support for T-Pain. This also led  to a conversation about mental health, and how a single comment can affect it. Check  out their reactions:
