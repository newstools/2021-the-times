Makhoa’s sister Malefaso Sello told  Sowetan his five children and the entire family were devastated. His brother Khehla Makhoa told the newspaper: “When we arrived there he was still inside the car and the engine was on. His seatbelt was still on him. We found all his belongings  there. His cellphones, watch, keys and laptop were inside the car.” Police spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo said police have opened a case of murder for investigation. TimesLIVE reported on Sunday  Makhoa was an employee of the Gauteng human settlements department. “We call on law enforcement agencies to do their work and apprehend the killers,” the department said. Makhoa and his colleagues in the Ekurhuleni offices were “working tirelessly to allocate the rightful beneficiaries into their RDP houses, remove illegal occupants from occupied RDP houses and prevent future occurrences of land and house invasions in the region,” said the department. MEC Lebogang Maile said: “This cowardly act will not deter us from our mandate to provide quality housing opportunities to those who deserve it the most.”
